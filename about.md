---

My name is Manel Rodero, I was born in Barcelona in 1972 and I am a Computer Engineer from the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/) (UPC · BarcelonaTech) since 1999.

I have developed my professional career in the [inLab](https://inlab.fib.upc.edu/) (former LCFIB) of the [Barcelona School of Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/) (FIB) since 1996, focusing on the design and implementation of the workstation environment for the PAS, PDI and Scholars.

This includes all responsibility for the management of this environment: operating system deployment, packaging and virtualization of applications, application of security policies, vulnerability management, antivirus / firewall management, etc.

Since February 1, 2019 I have joined the [UTG de l'Àmbit TIC del Campus Nord](https://utgcntic.upc.edu/) (UTGCNTIC).
